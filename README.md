Animates diffs between files.

Usage: Anidiff file1.txt file2.txt -- to display a Swing window animating the difference between file1.txt and file2.txt, line by line.

Add more files to the command line to continue animating, i.e., if you already have more than 2 versions you can use each as a kind of key frame.

To animate going back to the original file, repeat the original file, e.g., Anidiff a.txt b.txt c.txt a.txt
